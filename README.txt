DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

SUMMARY
This is a single webpage hosting a review of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, with an analysis of some of its striking social commentary. 
It was originally developed for a music course in University, and is credited as such on the webpage.

All ideas within the review, and all development was done by myself.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
The webpage is designed to be responsive for different devices.
